3. MASWaves Inversion 
3.1 Conducting the inversion analysis (MASWaves_inversion_MC) 
The function MASWaves_inversion_MC carries out the inversion analysis using a Monte Carlo based 
search procedure.
1) The program computes the theoretical (fundamental mode) dispersion curve for the stratified 
layer model defined by n, alpha_initial, beta_initial, rho and h_initial. The initial value of the 
dispersion misfit function is evaluated.
2) A Monte Carlo based search process is used in search of the shear wave velocity profile (i.e., 
value of beta and h for each layer) that provides the closest fit to the experimental data.
3) Inversion results are provided in the form of:
a. All sampled profiles
b. All sampled profiles whose theoretical dispersion curves fall within the upper/lower 
boundaries of the experimental curve ('accepted profiles') [optional]
