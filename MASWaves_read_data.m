%  [u,T,Tmax,L,x] = MASWaves_read_data(Filename,HeaderLines,fs,N,dx,x1,Direction)
%%
%  The function MASWaves_read_data loads recorded surface wave data into
%  MATLAB and determines the length of the receiver spread, the location
%  of individual receivers and the total recording time.
%
%% Input
%  Filename     Path of file where recorded data is stored [string]
%                - Recorded data should be stored in an ASCII-delimited
%                  text file (in ASCII format).
%                - Each recorded surface wave trace should be stored in
%                  a single column.
%  HeaderLines  Number of header lines
%  fs           Measuring frequency [Hz]
%  N            Number of receivers
%  dx           Receiver spacing [m]
%  x1           Source offset [m]
%  Direction    'forward' or 'backward' [string]
%                - 'forward':  Forward measurement.
%                              Seismic source is applied next to receiver 1
%                - 'backward': Backward measurement.
%                              Seismic source is applied next to receiver N
%
%% Output
%  u           u(x,t) offset-time shot gather
%  T           Time of individual recordings [s]
%  Tmax        Total recording time [s]
%  L           Length of receiver spread [m]
%  x           Location of receivers, distance from seismic source [m]
